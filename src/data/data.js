        "titleDesc":"The most abnormal of Grand Slam tennis seasons will end with something very normal: the 56th instalment of Rafael Nadal vs. Novak Djokovic in the Roland Garros final. On the podcast, Catherine, David and Matt discuss how both players made it there. How well did Nadal have to play against Diego Schwartzman? Did he get nervous towards the end? What happened for Tsitsipas to mount his comeback? Who will have the edge on Sunday? And who will Federer be supporting?! There’s also a preview of the women’s final between Iga Swiatek vs. Sofia Kenin and a rundown of results from the doubles, wheelchair and junior events.",

She joined to share her views on women's finalists Sofia Kenin and Iga Swiatek, preview Friday's men's semi-finals, and discuss her experience of this year's Roland Garros. In the second half of the show, Catherine, David and Matt react to Mary's thoughts, get stuck into the reasons behind Swiatek's sudden ascension, consider Kenin's trademarks on court, and make the case for why Stefanos Tsitsipas has a chance of upsetting Novak Djokovic.
